# The Nature of Code, NYUAD, JTerm 2016, NYC

Can we capture the unpredictable evolutionary and emergent properties of nature in software? Can understanding the mathematical principles behind our physical world world help us to create digital worlds? This class focuses on the programming strategies and techniques behind computer simulations of natural systems. We explore topics ranging from basic mathematics and physics concepts to more advanced simulations of complex systems. Subjects covered include forces, trigonometry, fractals, cellular automata, self-organization, and genetic algorithms. No computer programming experience is required, the course will start with the basics of code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with the [p5js](http://p5js.org/) framework). In addition to learning technical skills and discussing scientific concepts, students will have the opportunity to visit science museums, art galleries, and artist studios in the NYC area.

* Each student will be required to post their homework to the class blog (instructions provided in class).
* Over the course of the term, you should have completed ten blog posts (8 exercises, 1 final project proposal, 1 final project summary). In total this should amount to at least 7,000 words (equivalent to 18 double-spaced pages.) Each blog post should contain a written response to material presented in class (specific questions will be provided), a description of your homework assignment, and questions regarding the technical material.
* For your final project proposal and summary, you will be required to write about your project concept and project development process.
* Students will be expected to collaborate, to document their work, to make presentations and to discuss their ideas regularly in class.

## Teaching Methodologies
* Class time will be divided between technical lectures, independent project development, individual meetings with instructor, and project presentations / critique.
* In addition to regular class meetings, the instructor will organize a series of field trips to visit artist studios, gallery shows, and museum exhibits in the London area.

## Learning Outcomes
* Define the fundamentals of computation.
* Build creative software sketches that demonstrate knowledge of these fundamentals.
* Critically examine interactive art in the context of screen, sculpture, and web.
* Apply concepts from physics and mathematics to real-time software animation.
* Develop methodologies for simulating nature using computational algorithms.
* Propose and build a creative project made from computational methods.
